Firstly I have implemented a Na√Øve Bayes Classifier and evaluated its performance on the Large Movie review dataset, for different values of the hyper-parameter alpha.
Below are my results
Hyper-Parameter (ALPHA)	Train Accuracy (%)	Test Accuracy (%)
0.1	97.768	81.132
0.5	95.876	82.148
1.0	94.512	82.284
5.0	90.665	82.772
10.0	88.912	82.816


Nextly, I have implemented the Perceptron and Averaged Perceptron Algorithm and evaluated its performance on the dataset. I have evaluations for different values of the hyper-parameter(number of iterations)
Below are the results for the Perceptron and Average Perceptron
Iterations	Perceptron Accuracy (%)	Averaged Perceptron Accuracy (%)
	Train	Test	Train	Test
1	75.04	74.23	85.92	83.84
10	95.04	86.11	94.16	87.2
50	99.7	86.2	98.9	87.1
100	99.9	86.2	99.8	86.8
1000	100	86.1	99.89	86.77
